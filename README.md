GitLab API Utilities
======================

What is the purpose of this library?
------------------------------------

This Python utility enables programmatic assignment of access/ownership between groups of projects/users. Useful in
setting up team GitLab project structure and redistributing ownership of projects. May add some other GitLab API
utilities in future for maintaining/analysing Gitlab groups, projects and code review stats.
